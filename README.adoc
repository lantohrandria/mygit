# my git

## Push local branch to a remote branch with a different name
`git push <remote_repository> <local_branch>:<remote_branch>`

## Pull a remote branch to local
*Take care, pull will be done to the current local branch* (cf git checkout)

`git pull <remote_repository>:<remote_branch>`

## Commit local changes
`git add .`

`git commit -m "<message>"`

# Code review
## Check list
### General
. Functionality is implemented in a simple, maintainable, and reusable manner
. Find pieces of code which could be replaced by frameworks, favor using well proven frameworks and libraries as opposed to reinventing the wheel by writing your own

### Clean code
. Use of descriptive and meaningful variable, method and class names as opposed to relying too much on comments
.. For example, use of variables named _i_, _list_ is not correct
. Class and functions should be small and focus on doing one thing
. Method should not take too many imput parameter
. Detect dead code (commented out code or inside a _false_ branch)
. Use of the standard code formatting template
. Log must be used reasonably
. Presence of hard coded value
. Don't ignore or suppress exception, except for good reasons which must be justified
. Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD) Principles
.. *Single Responsibility Principle (SRS)*: a single class or function must have a unique responsibility
.. *Open Closed Principle*: While adding new functionality, existing code should not be modified. New functionality should be written in new classes and functions.
.. *Liskov substitutability principle*: The child class should not change the behavior (meaning) of the parent class. The child class can be used as a substitute for a base class.
.. *Interface segregation*: Do not create lengthy interfaces, instead split them into smaller interfaces based on the functionality. The interface should not contain any dependencies (parameters), which are not required for the expected functionality.
.. *Dependency Injection*: Do not hardcode the dependencies, instead inject them.

### Documentation
. Comments must explain *why you are doing*, not _what you are doing_. All hacks, workaround and temporary fixes must be commented
. Pending tasks mention pending tasks in your to-do comments, which can be tracked easily.
. Code should be commented
. Comments should be useful and understandable

### Tests
. Ensure that tests are written properly
. Ensure that tests have been run
. Tests should be relevant
. Tests coverage must be sufficient
